#  Credit Score classification

A machine learning-based web app that predicts a user's financial risk score based on various banking and income-related parameters.

##  Features

- Predicts based on user attributes such as income, credit history, and debt.
- Uses **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for prediction.
- Applied **Data Preprocessing**, **Feature Engineering**, and **EDA** to refine model performance.
- Designed for **static datasets** (no live training).

##  Model

- Algorithm: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Data: Static CSV dataset
- Preprocessing: Null removal, outlier handling, normalization
- Feature Engineering: Correlation checks, scaling
- Model trained on preprocessed data, not updated in real-time
- Giving us 75% Accuracy.

##  Visual Output

- Displays prediction along with user-specific indicators
- Graphs generated with Matplotlib/Seaborn
- API is used (like Spotify or others) to pull relevant visual assets dynamically (no music playback)
